### Milestone.
This was just a first attempt at using WASM with Go and React for something "real". There are lots of improvements to be made and I'd give my best to actively work on this. I plan to learn more and this project is my ticket to that.

Below are the lists of the things to be done. The list isnt exhaustive:
- [ ] Better UI. Responsive Image rendering.

- [ ] Support Multiple Image manipulation at once --stress testing so as to utilize the speed WebAssembly promises ðŸ™ƒðŸ˜‰! 

- [ ] Support live manipulation --sliders to apply effect (Moonshot)

- [ ] Support more image effects. Dropdown selection of images
